# üõ°Ô∏è SIEM Threat Detection Lab Using Splunk & Atomic Red Team

This project simulates a small-scale Security Operations Center (SOC) using **Splunk**, **Sysmon**, **Splunk Universal Forwarder**, and **Atomic Red Team**. The lab demonstrates real-world threat detection, alerting, and correlation of attacker behavior mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

---

## üìå Project Summary

In this lab, a Windows 10 virtual machine was configured to simulate attacker behavior, while an Ubuntu Server VM hosted Splunk Enterprise to ingest logs for detection. Logs were forwarded using Splunk Universal Forwarder, and deep telemetry was collected via Sysmon. Atomic Red Team was used to safely simulate adversary techniques such as:

- Brute force login attempts
- Suspicious PowerShell execution
- Registry-based persistence

Multiple Splunk dashboards, alerts, and correlation rules were implemented to detect these behaviors in real time.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. **Set up VMs** with VirtualBox: Windows 10 (SOC) and Ubuntu Server (Splunk)
2. **Install Splunk Enterprise** on Ubuntu Server
3. **Install Splunk Universal Forwarder + Sysmon** on Windows 10 VM
4. **Ingest logs into Splunk**, verify via search
5. **Simulate attacks** using Atomic Red Team on Windows
6. **Visualize detections** in dashboards
7. **Set alerts** for real-time detection
8. **Run correlation SPL queries** and save as reports
